Welcome to the E-Commerce Web Application project!

To begin, download this entire repository. Make sure the folders in src are included in the download or it will not work.

Clone Module 6's project if needed: https://github.com/meganarmas/Mini-Project-E-commerce-API

Make sure to follow these steps once you have everything in VS Code:
1. cd e-commerce-web-app
2. npm install axios
3. npm install react-router-dom
4. npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

Once everything has been download, run "npx run dev" to open the development server. Click on the link (should be localhost:5173 unless you are running another React project) to run through everything.
